Make Connections and Friends
-----------------------------------------

In High Fidelity, you can establish a connection with someone else by shaking hands with them. With your hand controllers, place your hands near each other and hold the grip button. Desktop users can press and hold ``X`` on their keyboard. 

Once you make a connection with someone, they will appear under Connections in the `The People app`_. You will also appear on their list of connections. You will be able to see where they are in the metaverse, and you can travel to them at any time. 

To mark a connection as a friend, check the box next to their name in the People app. You can make yourself available to only your friends using the People app.

The People App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The People app provides a set of tools that help users manage their interactions with people in the metaverse. It gives you a list of the people nearby (in the same domain as you), and gives you easy access to all of your connections. From the People app, you can:

Use the People App as an Admin
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As an administrator in a domain, you will have privileges to maintain a domain. The People app will have an additional column that allows an admin to silence and ban users in the same domain.

Your Privacy Bubble
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can enable a privacy bubble that protects your personal space in the metaverse. When it is enabled, other people will disappear if they get too close to you. Your privacy bubble is disabled by default. To enable it, pull up your tablet or HUD and click **Bubble**. In Desktop mode, you can also use the keyboard shortcut ``CTRL`` + ``N``.

-----------------------------------------
Attend Live Events
-----------------------------------------

One of the great things about virtual reality is that you can attend events. High Fidelity regularly hosts events such as workshops, lectures on VR, and town hall meetings to meet our team. Click here to `view all upcoming events <https://tockify.com/hifieventscalendar/agenda>`_. Events are a great place to meet others and share experiences with others around the world.

To attend an event, simply go to the hosted domain at the time of the event.


-----------------------------------------
Express Yourself
-----------------------------------------

There are many ways you can express yourself in High Fidelity, such as animating the mouth of your avatar or using gestures in the **Emote** app. 

By default, all avatars will use a standard set of animations, such as your eyes blinking or your mouth opening and closing as you talk. When you are using a VR controller, your avatar will automatically mimic your hand gestures and movements. 


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Emote App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Emote app is a way for desktop users to express themselves without using VR controllers. With this app, you can display feelings by: crying, acting surprised, dancing, cheering, waving, falling, pointing, clapping, sitting, or showing love.

-----------------------------------------
Chat with Users
-----------------------------------------

High Fidelity doesn't yet have a default text chat option that works well for both HMD and desktop users as most HMD users can't type easily. Our extensible open-source scripting and UI gives you the ability to create the features you want, including text chat. There are some great scripts for chat that have already been built by community members, and a few are described below.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
HiFi Local Chat 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This clean, reliable, and well-written chat script was created by alpha user ctrlaltdavid. 

.. image:: _images/hifi-local-chat-by-ctrlaltdavid.png

To run the script:

1. In Interface, go to **Edit > Open and Run Script from URL**.
2. Paste this `URL <http://ctrlaltstudio.com/downloads/hifi/scripts/chat.js>`__.

The script will start running and display a text chat window pop-up. You can use this window to chat with other users in the same domain who are running the same script. If text chat is important to you, you can add this to your default scripts so it's always there.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
COM Script Version 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AlphaVersionD has authored an equally powerful and friendly script that runs on a domain. All users that visit a domain with the script can chat with one another, without installing a separate app or script. With this script, you have the power to enable chat on any of your own domains.

.. note:: You can run a script only in a domain where you have the right permissions. Ensure that you have the right permissions in a domain where you wish to use the COM Script.

To install COM Script in your domain:

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**. 
2. Click the 'zone' icon to create a zone entity.
3. In the 'Properties' tab of the zone entity, paste this `URL <http://metaversecafes.com/HighFidelity/QueenCity/A_2016_Q_wab/AQUI/COM_v1.0.js>`_.

COM Script version 1 is now running in the zone in your domain!
