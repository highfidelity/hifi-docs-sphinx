Use Your VR Equipment
#########################

To get the best and most immersive experience in High Fidelity, you should use VR equipment such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Only then will you be able to interact with people in 3D, track body movements, and easily engage with the objects around you.

To interact with people in 3D and track body movements, you will need to use VR equipment such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. With VR equipment, you can have a fully immersive experience in High Fidelity.

.. note:: If you want to jump, fly, or strafe (walk sideways) in VR, you must enable it under **Settings > Controls > VR Movement**.

Movement Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to change your avatar's walking or running speed, or change your direction, you can use our movement controls. 

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Menu > Settings > Controls**.
2. In the 'Settings' tab, under VR movement, you will see a list of advanced movement control options.

Gamepad
-------------------------

If your HMD does not come equipped with hand controllers, you can use a gamepad. However, High Fidelity is best experienced with VR equipment or the keyboard in Desktop mode.

-----------------------------------------
Motion Capture Using Vive Trackers
-----------------------------------------

You can enhance your High Fidelity experience using full body motion capture (mocap). High Fidelity currently supports mocap using HTC Vive Trackers. 

Vive trackers need to be strapped to the body part you wish to track. You can replace the HMD and hand controllers with trackers if you only need to track the movement of your head and hands. 

You can set up different mocap systems:

+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Mocap System        | Equipment Needed         | Recommended Straps                                      |
+=====================+==========================+=========================================================+
| Head                | HMD or 1 Vive Tracker    | Head strap for Vive Tracker                             |
+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Hands               | Hand controllers or      | Hand strap for Vive Tracker                             |
|                     | 2 Vive Trackers          |                                                         |

| Feet                | 2 Hand Controllers       |                                                         |

+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Head + Hands +      | 5 Vive Trackers + HMD +  | Shoulder straps                                         |
| Feet + Hips +       | 2 Hand Controllers       |                                                         |
| Shoulders           |                          |                                                         |
+---------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: You can replace the HMD and hand controllers with trackers if you only need to track the movement of your head and hands.

Configure Your Mocap System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Strap your Vive trackers to your body as shown in the image.
2. Connect your trackers, HMD, and controllers to SteamVR.
3. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Menu > Settings > Calibration**.
4. Configure your mocap system by:

   * Selecting the right device for your head and hands. If you're using a head tracker instead of an HMD, click 'Use HTC Vive Devices in Desktop Mode'.
   * Selecting the body position of any additional trackers. 
   
   .. image:: _images/vive-config.PNG
   
5. Click 'Apply and Calibrate'.
6. Stand in a T-Pose until the timer counts down to zero:

   * Feet together
   * Arms out
   * Head looking straight ahead.
   
7. Check to see that each tracker is tracking the corresponding joint on your avatar. 
8. You can also calibrate your trackers without using your tablet. Once you apply your configuration, stand in a T-Pose and hold the following four buttons together for 1 second: Left Trigger, Right Trigger, Left Menu Button, Right Menu Button. You can press the same buttons together for a second to remove your calibration from the trackers.

.. note:: When you setup your Vive, you choose which way to point the arrow as your reference. During calibration,  it is important that you face the same direction. If you can not remember the arrow's directon, press the Vive System Menu Button and look on the ground for a marker. This is important to make sure your joints are oriented correctly.

|                                 | * Do you have the correct number of dongles plugged in to your computer. You will need one dongle per tracker. If you are performing with all 7, then you may need a USB hub to handle them. |

.. note:: Remember to charge your trackers when you aren't using them so that you don't have to deal with a low battery tracker negatively impacting your performance.
