| You are free to price your item however you’d like. We encourage you to consider these questions:  |
|                                                                                                    |
| * How are other items of similar quality in this category priced?                                  |
| * Are you choosing a price that you feel reflects the time and effort required to create the item? |
|   Don’t sell yourself short!                                                                       |
| * If you have multiple items for sale on the Marketplace, in essence you have a brand. Do you have |
|   a specific target audience in mind? New users? Users looking for something truly unique? Take    |
|   this into account.                                                                               |
| * Is your item a limited edition? If an item is of good quality and in limited supply, it may      |
|   merit a higher price.                                                                            |

|                                                                                                    |
| Does my avatar have too many polys?                                                                |
+====================================================================================================+
| We do not have a hard poly limit on avatars, however we recommend keeping avatars under 80k.       |
| Consider normal mapping your models to preserve high detail rather than excessive poly counts.     |

+====================================================================================================+
| Submissions can be as large as necessary for the content you are uploading, but keep in mind       |
| that large items can adversely impact loading times for users. If possible, we recommend keeping   |
| submissions under 40MB total.                                                                      |

+====================================================================================================+
| You can submit content without putting it up for sale. However, you will still need to go through  |
| the certification process and be held to Marketplace standards. Content not submitted for review   |
| will expire after 30 days and will no longer be accessible.                                        |
|                                                                                                    |
| You should always keep backups of your files, as we cannot ensure the return of your files if      |
| they are corrupted or lost.                                                                        |

| Your submission will be evaluated by our team. Once our team has completed evaluation, you will    |
| receive an email telling you that your item was accepted or declined with reasons and resubmission |
| guidelines.                                                                                        |
