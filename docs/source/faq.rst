| You are free to price your item however you’d like. We encourage you to consider these questions:   |
|                                                                                                     |
| * How are other items of similar quality in this category priced?                                   |
| * Are you choosing a price that you feel reflects the time and effort required to create the item?  |
|   Don’t sell yourself short!                                                                        |
| * If you have multiple items for sale on the Marketplace, in essence you have a brand. Do you have  |
|   a specific target audience in mind? New users? Users looking for something truly unique? Take     |
|   this into account.                                                                                |
| * Is your item a limited edition? If an item is of good quality and in limited supply, it may       |
|   merit a higher price.                                                                             |

|                                                                                                     |
| Does my avatar have too many polys?                                                                 |
+=====================================================================================================+
| We do not have a hard poly limit on avatars, however we recommend keeping avatars under 80k.        |
| Consider normal mapping your models to preserve high detail rather than excessive poly counts.      |

+=====================================================================================================+
| Submissions can be as large as necessary for the content you are uploading, but keep in mind        |
| that large items can adversely impact loading times for users. If possible, we recommend keeping    |
| submissions under 40MB total.                                                                       |

+=====================================================================================================+
| You can submit content without putting it up for sale. However, you will still need to go through   |
| the certification process and be held to Marketplace standards. Content not submitted for review    |
| will expire after 30 days and will no longer be accessible.                                         |

| You should always keep backups of your files, as we cannot ensure the return of your files if       |

| The Marketplace content I purchased has disappeared. Where did it go?                               |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Marketplace items behave like items in the real world. You can have only one copy of each item you  |
| purchase. An item you bought from the Marketplace will disappear if you rez it elsewhere. This is   |
| done using a process called `Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV) <#q11>`_.                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                                                     |
| Can I rez multiple copies of a Marketplace item?                                                    |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Yes, only if the seller has given permission to do so. A seller can modify settings to allow        |
| users to `rez multiple copies <sell/add-item.html#unlimited-rezzing-of-your-item>`_ of their item   |
| in a single domain. Otherwise, you will need to buy multiple copies of the item.                    |
| Marketplace items behave like items in the real world. You can have only one copy of each item you  |
| purchase unless specified by the seller.                                                            |

|                                                                                                     |
| What is Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV)?                                                          |
+=====================================================================================================+
| Dynamic Domain Verification (DDV) is a process running on your domain, which ensures that you can   |
| rez only one copy of each item purchased on the Marketplace. This is done to protect the            |
| intellectual property rights of the creators. DDV will determine if an item has been moved to a new |
| domain and will remove it from the old domain. DDV requires the domain to be running and will       |
| delete items from domains with no Place or domain name. Temporary names are accepted.               |
| DDV often runs within an hour after you rez a Marketplace item again. Its frequency is controlled   |
| by the domain's control panel.                                                                      |

|                                                                                                     |
| What happens to my Marketplace content when I change my domain ID?                                  |
+=====================================================================================================+
| When you change your domain ID, it's the same as creating a new domain. Even though the existing    |
| content may temporarily appear in the new domain, the system considers the Marketplace items as     |
| existing on the old domain. DDV will remove the Marketplace items from the new domain. You will     |
| have to rez the items again in the new domain.                                                      |

|                                                                                                     |
| What happens to my Marketplace content when I export a backup to another domain?                    |
+=====================================================================================================+
| When you restore a backup or exported domain onto a new server with a different domain ID, DDV will |
| consider the Marketplace item as belonging to the old domain, and will delete them from the new     |
| domain. You will have to rez the Marketplace items again in the new domain.                         |
