# Upload Your Environment

Before uploading your environment to the Marketplace, make sure that you created the environment in a domain where you have access to the administration panel. Keep in mind that _all_ content in the domain will be included in your upload. Once your domain is set up, you are ready to upload your environment.

1. Open your 'Domain Administration Panel'. If you are on a local sandbox, open it by clicking on the High Fidelity icon in the taskbar notifications and 'click Settings'. ![](_images/sandbox-settings.png)

3. In the Content Archives section, click 'Generate New Archive'.
4. Enter a name for your archive and click 'Generate Archive'. It will appear just below the 'Generate New Archive' button. ![](_images/environment-archive.png)
