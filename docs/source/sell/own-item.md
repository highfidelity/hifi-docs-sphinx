# Ownership of Your Items 

In the metaverse, it can be tricky to verify the legitimacy or ownership of a piece of property. High Fidelity implemented a blockchain tracking system that allows content creators to certify their creations and records all transactions made using HFC.

## Blockchain Protection
A blockchain is a type of database, one that is maintained by thousands of different people and companies, at the same time. Information written to that database is permanent, so it can’t be changed and it can't be lost. 

High Fidelity's blockchain allows creators to permanently attach digital certificates to their creations that  securely identifies their origin and unique ownership when they are later encountered anywhere in the virtual world. The blockchain also gives control over the sale, ownership and transfer of certified goods completely over to their creators and owners — there is no way for intermediary agents (such as a company like High Fidelity or a VR server operator) to take action to change the status of something you own.

Once your Marketplace item is certified, you are permanently and indelibly recorded as its creator. Any instance of that item in the metaverse has a corresponding entry in the blockchain, and its authenticity, history, value, and ownership can be verified at any time. This makes it easy to differentiate the real deal from a counterfeit copy, and allows your property to retain its value.

## PoP License and Certificate
High Fidelity uses a [Proof of Provenance License (PoP License)](https://digitalassetregistry.com/PoP-License/v1/) and certification to protect any digital goods or assets that you have created and sold. In its simplest form, Proof of Provenance (PoP) documents an asset’s chain of ownership, its characteristics, and its entire history, from certification onward. 

When you put up an item for review on the Marketplace, it has to be approved by the digital asset registry to ensure that it is functional, that it is not obviously violating copyright laws, and that it is not a copy of any other item previously approved by the registry.

Once an item is approved by the registry, you (the user) will receive a PoP Certificate of edition 0 of the item. This PoP Certificate contains static properties about the item and cannot be altered. This means all the descriptors will always remain the same and your item's Certificate cannot be changed. It can only be changed when the PoP Certificate is transferred.

If you place this item on sale on the Marketplace, any other users purchasing your item will receive subsequent editions of your item. Every time a user purchases your item, it is certified and cryptographically signed by the Marketplace. The PoP Certificate proves that you possess an item through legal means.

## Attributions
Attributions are often used to credit other users who have contributed to an item. They can also link to an external portfolio to display more of your work. 

For some submissions, attributions are legally required by other content. Some third party content will use licenses like MIT or Creative Commons, which require special attributions. When using third party content in your own items, make sure you understand the license (if any) used by the content and respect attribution requirements accordingly. 

When you [add your item](add-item.html) to the Marketplace, the form includes fields to insert any attributions for your submission.
